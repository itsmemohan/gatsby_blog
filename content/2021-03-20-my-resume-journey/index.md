In this season where 'positive' was such a deadly word, I too was hit by a bug called 'Procrastination'. This has affected humanity for generations and I wish the scientists could find a cure soon. I soon realized its time to fight it and get out of the couch of comfort and unravel the sheets of laziness. Pardon my dramatic syncracies, I was affected by never ending chores of a married Man. End of the day, You are just a device with a remote control. 

## Resume Hunting Spree
Well, It was ages ago (exactly 3 years) that I decided to have a modern resume built however I tried multiple sites / options , the craving was incomplete. My struggle continued. Finally, the options that I narrowed to build my resume are as follows

1. Json Resume
2. React Resume Builders

As a noob, I was crawling and understanding HTML, CSS, I really liked the project of having the resume in a defined format which is simple and user friendly. However blame it on my technical knowledge, I was unable to fit it to a proper theme ( I loved Stack Overflow theme) and export it to pdf format. I spent hours together spread across years however my end result was far from satisfactory. I really liked the project and wish if they come up with new templates and allow us to design multiple resumes in different formats easily. I admire the team who came up with this concept [Json Resume Rocks] https://jsonresume.org

The other option that I had is to utilize the resume builders and thanks to Dev.to and the vibrant community , I had the option to test these resume generators who had built it as part of their project and also shared wonderful resources. In this journey, One project which I personally liked it is [Resume Builder in React] https://resumejs.netlify.app

## Why I liked it

1. It was simple and customization to the core.
2. The option to choose various sections and even rearrange the order in my resume was certainly the icing on the cake.
3. The option to download the entire data into a .json format.
4. Whenever any changes to be made, just import the .json format file and modify the changes from the website.
5. Autosave feature.

My hearfelt congratulations to the entire team and I request the community to give it a try. Check out their github profile https://github.com/aamay001/react-resume
